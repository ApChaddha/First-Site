		<h3>BUG BOUNTY HUNTING</h3>
			<p>
				Bug bounty hunting is the act of finding security vulnerabilities or bugs in a website, and responsibly disclosing it to that company’s security team in an ethical way. Bug bounties, also known as responsible disclosure programs, are setup by companies to encourage people to report potential issues discovered on their sites. Some companies choose to reward a researcher with bounty, swag, or an entry in their hall-of-fame list. If you are interested in web application security then they have a great place of honing your skills, with the potential of earning some bounty and credibility at the same time.

		<h3>WEB APPLICATION PENETRATION TESTING</h3>
			<p>
				The Web Application Penetration Testing course from Cyber Soldier Cyber Security Consultancy is a totally hands-on learning experience. From the first day to the last day, you will learn the ins and outs of Web App Pen Testing by attending thought-provoking lectures led by an expert instructor. Every lecture is directly followed up by a comprehensive lab exercise (we also set up and provide lab workstations so you don’t waste valuable class time installing tools and apps). Typical lab exercises consist of a real-world app that demonstrates a vulnerability commonly found in a web app.

				You learn how to assess the application much as a black hat hacker would, and then exploit the app so that you can demonstrate the true risk of the vulnerability to the application owner. This can involve taking control of the application itself, downloading data the application stores, or potentially using the app as a launching pad to attack unsuspecting visitors with a malicious script. Finally, the lab will follow up with remediation steps so that the application owner can properly close down the security hole for good.
