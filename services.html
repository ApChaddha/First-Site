		<h1 align="center">IT SECURITY</h1>
		<p>
			Penetration testing – whether it’s internal or external, white-box or black-box – uncovers critical issues and demonstrates how well your network and information assets are protected. Because Cyber Soldier Technologies thinks and acts like an attacker, you can discover critical vulnerabilities and remediate them before they are exploited.
		</p>
		<p>
			Pen Testers actively attempt to ‘exploit’ vulnerabilities and exposures in a company’s infrastructure, applications, people and processes. Through exploitation, Cyber Soldier Technologies is able to provide context around the vulnerability, impact, threat and the likelihood of a breach in an information asset. It is frequently possible for a pen tester to gain remote access to operating systems, application logic and database records. Through active exploitation of direct and interconnected systems, Nettitude can provide strategic guidance on risk and tailored advice on counter measures.
		</p>
			<h3>TYPES OF PENESTRATION TESTING</h3>
			<h2>Internal Penetration Testing</h2>
			<p>
				This type of testing assesses security through the eye of an internal user, a temporary worker, or an individual that has physical access to the organisations’ buildings over its Local Area Network (LAN) or through Wi-Fi networks.The tests will observe whether it is possible to gain access to privileged company information from systems that are inside the corporate firewalls.
			</p>
			<h2>External Penetration Testing</h2>
			<p>
				This type of testing assesses an organizations infrastructure from outside of the perimeter firewall on the Internet. It assesses the environment from the vantage point of an internet hacker, a competitor or a supplier with limited information about the internet facing environment.
